# Calculator-Intern-NITI



Developed a calculator project for my internship at Intern NITI. 

This project not only showcases my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but also demonstrates my ability to design a user-friendly interface, implement basic arithmetic operations, handle user input and errors effectively, and incorporate features such as memory functions, decimal handling, and keyboard support. 

The codebase is organized for readability, includes unit testing for functionality verification, and ensures a responsive layout for diverse devices.
